# Data Structures and Algorithms (AED)

This repository is dedicated to the **Data Structures and Algorithms (AED)** course from my Information Systems program. It contains class materials, exercises, and projects developed throughout the course, serving as a personal study and reference resource.

## Overview

- **Purpose:** To document my learning journey and practice with data structures and algorithms, compiling exercises and projects completed during the course.
- **Target Audience:** This repository is intended exclusively for personal use and to showcase my work on my profile. External contributions are not accepted.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **AED/**
  - **Conceito de AED.txt:** A text file outlining the fundamental concepts and theories of the course.
  - **Classes/**
    - **Class 2 - Structs:** Contains exercises and examples related to handling structures (structs) in C/C++.
    - **Class 3 - Recursion:** Includes comparative implementations of iterative and recursive solutions (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci, string inversion, etc.).
    - **Class 4 - List, Stack, Queue:** Contains practical examples and exercises using lists, stacks, and queues.
  - **Home Studies/**
    - Includes materials and exercises from Classes 1 and 2 for supplementary study.
  - **List 01/**
    - Contains a collection of exercises organized by topics, such as:
      - List, Stack and Queue
      - Recursive vs. Iterative approaches
      - Struct Exercises

## How to Use

1. **Navigation:** Browse the folders based on the topic you wish to review, whether you are refreshing theoretical concepts or analyzing practical implementations.
2. **Study and Reference:** Utilize the code files and documents to deepen your understanding of the algorithms and data structures covered in the course.
3. **Personal Growth:** This repository is continuously evolving with new implementations and improvements based on my ongoing learning process.
